# Chinese Remainder Theorem & Miller-Rabin Primality Test

This repository contains an implementation of:

1. **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)** - A method for solving systems of simultaneous modular congruences.
2. **Miller-Rabin Primality Test** - A probabilistic algorithm for determining the primality of a number.

## File Structure

Both programs are implemented in **one file** for ease of execution and testing.

## Features

- Implementation of the **Chinese Remainder Theorem** using modular inverses.
- Implementation of the **Miller-Rabin primality test** with configurable witness count.
- Unit tests for both functions using Python's `unittest` framework.

## How to Run

Execute the script using Python:

```sh
python main.py
```

This will run all unit tests to verify correctness.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `functools`, `random`, `unittest` (built-in modules)

## Unit Tests

The script includes **10 tests** for each algorithm to verify correctness and edge cases.
